\section{Complications}
\label{chap:complications}

Discussion of the limitations of this methodology / approach:
 - effects of hardware limitations
 - effects of hyperparameter tuning
 - 

\subsection{Resource Constraints}
\label{resource-constraints}

Discussion of how limited hardware / time affects results.

\subsection{Fundamental Constraints}
\label{fundamental-constraints}

Discussion of how this is not really a one-to-one comparison. Each approach is targeting a different problem here.

Segueway into discussion on how the unique challenges of 3D semantic segmentation (memory constraints, speed, sparsity, etc.) make challenges like this somewhat misleading.

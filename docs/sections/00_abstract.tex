\section*{Abstract}

3D Semantic Segmentation is an enabling technology for Autonomous Driving, but evaluation of different approaches is complex. In this paper we recreate benchmarks for popular segmentation algorithms and discuss challenges and discrepencies in our results. We conclude with recommendations to improve 3D Semantic Segmentation evaluation processes to provide better feedback to researchers and integrators alike.

\section*{Abstract}

3D Semantic Segmentation is an enabling technology for Autonomous Driving, but evaluation of different approaches is still in its infancy. In this paper we attempt to recreate benchmarks for popular segmentation algorithms and discuss the challenges and discrepencies in our results. We conclude with recommendations to improve the process of 3D Semantic Segmentation evaluation in the hopes of providing better feedback to researchers and integrators alike.
